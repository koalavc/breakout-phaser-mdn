# Breakout-Phaser Tutorial
Followed the [MDN tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_breakout_game_Phaser) on recreating Breakout using Phaser, a 2D game framework. 

### Future goals for this repo
- Revamp the .js file and use ES6 standards
- Try to find a way to make the game more appealing
